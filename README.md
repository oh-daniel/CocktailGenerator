# CocktailGenerator

In this project, students are expected to build a website using the
Express/Node.js platform, with the Axios HTTP client, that integrates a chosen
public API from the given list: Public API Lists. The website should interact
with the chosen API, retrieve data, and present it in a user-friendly manner.

For this project, I am using the CocktailDB API to make a website that gives the user a random
cocktail recipe with images of the cocktail.
This is the README file for the project
